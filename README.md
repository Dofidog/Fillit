# Fillit
Project Fillit at Hive Helsinki

In this project, we had to create a program, which takes given tetriminos as a file and sorts them in a smallest square possible.
This program was made by me and my project-partner jHimanen.

example file with four tetriminos:

..#.

.##.

..#.

....




.##.

.#..

which results in:

BBAD

BAAD

BCAD

CCCD

invalid examples:
